## CNS_SampleProject
Hello! 
My name is Nadiia, I'm Automation QA.
This is a sample project showcasing my skills.

### Description
The CNS Sample Project (C#, Nunit, Selenium) is a simple project that demonstrates concepts and practices in AQA. 
It includes examples of unit tests, API interactions, and basic project structure. 
Page Object Pattern is used to make project maintainable and easy-to-navigate.
Additionally, I've implemented Generics to facilitate the construction of method chains. 
This approach allows some methods to be universal and not bound to a specific class instance, enhancing flexibility and usability.
